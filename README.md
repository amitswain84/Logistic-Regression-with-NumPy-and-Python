# Logistic-Regression-with-NumPy-and-Python
The aim of this project and is to implement all the machinery, including gradient descent, cost function, and logistic regression, of the various learning algorithms yourself, so you have a deeper understanding of the fundamentals. By the time you complete this project, you will be able to build a logistic regression model using Python and NumPy, conduct basic exploratory data analysis, and implement gradient descent from scratch.

1.Introduction and Project Overview

2.Load the Data and Import Libraries

3.Visualize the Data

4.Define the Logistic Sigmoid Function 𝜎(𝑧)

5.Compute the Cost Function 𝐽(𝜃) and Gradient

6.Cost and Gradient at Initialization

7.Implement Gradient Descent

8.Plotting the Convergence of 𝐽(𝜃)

9.Plotting the Decision Boundary

10.Predictions Using the Optimized 𝜃 Values
